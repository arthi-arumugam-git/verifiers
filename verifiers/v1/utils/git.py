"""Persist an agent's final git patch into `trace.info` at finalize time.

SWE-style tasksets call `capture_patch` from `Task.finalize` — after the harness
finishes, while the runtime is live, before scoring mutates the repo (restoring
test files, switching commits) — so the diff is exactly what the agent produced,
including edits to test files (intentional: they reveal reward hacking), and
excluding whatever `snapshot_untracked` recorded before the agent started.

The diff is taken against `base_commit` when the caller has one — a dataset row
field, or a SHA recorded with `resolve_head` at setup time and kept in host
memory (never the sandbox, where an agent could tamper with it) — so commits the
agent made are included. Bare `HEAD` is the fallback of last resort and misses
agent commits.

    Two failure modes, attributed differently, because they deserve different outcomes.

    A non-zero exit means the box answered and git refused: a stale `index.lock` from a
    killed agent command, a deleted `.git`, a `base_commit` the agent rewrote out of
    existence, a disk it filled. That is the agent's own environment, so it records
    `info["patch_error"]` and lets the rollout score — a run with no patch grades as a
    run that changed nothing, which is the right reward.

    An exception means the box never answered: the sandbox died, the exec timed out,
    the transport dropped. Nothing there is the policy's doing, so it raises. Scoring
    the rollout anyway would feed a zero to training that says only that our
    infrastructure failed.

    `write_path` additionally writes the patch to that path inside the box, for tasks
    graded in a second sandbox. Point it at `vf.ARTIFACTS_DIR` (e.g.
    `/logs/artifacts/patch.diff`) and collection picks it up with no declaration. Leave
    it on the convention sweep rather than declaring it as an `Artifact`: a declared
    path is collected strictly, which would turn an agent-broken repo into a rollout
    error instead of the low score it should earn.
